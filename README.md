## Notebook Summaries

### 1. Clustering with Embeddings for Mapping

#### Overview
This notebook focuses on creating and processing embeddings to enable clustering for mapping purposes. The primary tools include OpenAI's embedding model (`text-embedding-ada-002`), clustering algorithms (e.g., MiniBatchKMeans), and batch processing for handling large datasets efficiently.

#### Key Components
- **Embedding Generation**: Uses OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` to generate text embeddings. The notebook emphasizes processing data in batches to ensure efficiency, especially when working with large datasets.
- **Unifying Batches**: Combines multiple batches of embeddings into a unified CSV for further processing, validating the consistency and correctness of embeddings during the consolidation process.
- **Embedding Verification**: Validates that each embedding has the correct dimensionality, and flags any discrepancies to ensure data quality.
- **Clustering Model Training**: Implements MiniBatchKMeans to incrementally train on the embeddings, which helps categorize data points into meaningful groups. The model is saved and uploaded for future use.
- **Cluster Assignment and Sampling**: Loads the trained clustering model to assign cluster labels to the embeddings and performs data sampling from each cluster, which is useful for analyzing representative samples.

### 2. Fasttext vs LangDetect vs LangID

#### Overview
This notebook evaluates three different tools for language detection: FastText, LangDetect, and LangID. The aim is to compare their performance on a set of multilingual data, focusing on accuracy, consistency, and efficiency.

#### Key Components
- **Language Detection Tools**:
  - **FastText**: A Facebook-developed tool that utilizes embeddings to identify language.
  - **LangDetect**: A port of Google's language-detection library.
  - **LangID**: A lightweight library that works well in resource-constrained environments.
- **Performance Comparison**: Compares the detection accuracy across multiple languages, providing insights into the pros and cons of each tool. This helps in determining which model is the most suitable depending on use cases like accuracy vs. computational efficiency.
- **Visual Analysis**: Includes visualizations that illustrate the performance, such as confusion matrices and comparison graphs, highlighting differences between the approaches.

### 3. Haiku Async Labeling

#### Overview
The `haiku_async_labeling` notebook explores asynchronous processing methods for labeling data using multiple APIs.

#### Key Components
- **Asynchronous API Calls**: Uses Python's `asyncio` library to efficiently handle multiple API requests for labeling purposes. The asynchronous approach significantly reduces time consumption compared to traditional synchronous methods.
- **Labeling Job Titles**: Demonstrates the labeling of job titles using external APIs, focusing on improving labeling efficiency. This workflow is particularly relevant for high-throughput labeling scenarios.
- **Result Aggregation**: Aggregates results from different APIs and evaluates the consistency of responses. Includes error-handling mechanisms to manage failed requests and retries, ensuring completeness in data collection.

### 4. Inference Pipeline

#### Overview
This notebook presents an inference pipeline designed for classifying job titles, from preprocessing to model evaluation and serialization.

#### Key Components
- **Pipeline Structure**: Covers data ingestion, preprocessing, feature extraction, model inference, and post-processing. It's a comprehensive walkthrough for setting up a practical NLP inference workflow.
- **Feature Engineering**: Implements feature extraction using embedding models, transforming raw job titles into meaningful numerical features for classification.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Trains a classification model (e.g., XGBoost) and evaluates its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The notebook also highlights the importance of hyperparameter tuning.
- **Error Analysis**: Conducts a detailed error analysis to understand model misclassifications, using confusion matrices and analyzing individual instances to identify common patterns among errors.
- **Model Serialization**: Finally, serializes the trained model to a `.pkl` file for future use, facilitating deployment.

### 5. Ultra-Efficient Cleaning of 400M Titles with Embeddings

#### Overview
This notebook details an approach for cleaning a massive dataset consisting of 400 million job titles, leveraging embeddings to automate the process.

#### Key Components
- **Data Cleaning Challenges**: Discusses the complexities involved in handling extremely large datasets and how embedding-based methods can provide scalable solutions.
- **Embedding Utilization**: Uses embedding models to transform job titles into vectors, then clusters these vectors to identify and remove duplicate or low-quality entries, effectively cleaning the dataset.
- **Batch Processing**: Similar to the other notebooks, it emphasizes batch processing to make the approach efficient and feasible for large-scale data.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the cleaned dataset retains only valid, unique entries, significantly reducing dataset size while retaining the most informative titles.

## Key Technologies and Concepts

- **Embeddings and NLP Models**: Leveraging OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` and other embedding models is a consistent theme across the notebooks. Embeddings help in transforming text into numerical vectors that machine learning models can use for various downstream tasks.
- **Batch Processing**: Large-scale data requires efficient processing methods. Batch handling is incorporated to manage memory usage and make the pipeline scalable.
- **Clustering**: MiniBatchKMeans clustering is employed to group similar data points. Clustering is used both for creating meaningful groupings and for sampling purposes.
- **Language Detection**: FastText, LangDetect, and LangID are compared to determine the best language detection approach, providing a clear comparison for different application scenarios.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Asynchronous programming with Python's `asyncio` allows efficient API interactions, particularly useful when dealing with external data labeling processes.
- **Model Inference and Error Analysis**: Setting up inference pipelines and performing error analysis helps refine models to improve accuracy and reliability, while serialization ensures the model can be used repeatedly in production.
